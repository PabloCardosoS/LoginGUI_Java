# Login Screen in Java

This project is a small Java program that implements a login screen where the user must enter an email and password to access the system. It was developed using **Java Swing**, **AWT**, and **JFrame** to create the graphical interface of the login window.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Swing**
- **AWT**
- **JFrame**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**

## Features

- Login screen with fields for **email** and **password**.
- Simple credential validation (fixed username and password for the example).
- Display of success or error messages based on user input.

## Description

This project aims to demonstrate the creation of a simple login graphical interface using **Swing** and **AWT**. The program provides a login window where the user can enter an email and password, validated with fixed credentials in the code. The application displays a success or error message depending on the input.

## Notes

- This project was developed as part of learning about graphical user interfaces in Java.
- The login validation can be extended to a real system, such as integrating with a database or API authentication.
